I spiced up what is otherwise a handy template for a quote tool by making the example purpose the cloning for your own mammoth meatball. Don't know what that is? Check this article https://www.businessinsider.com/lab-grown-woolly-mammoth-meatball-taste-sheep-elephant-dna-2023-4

Check the [custom.js](https://github.com/haa-gg/Vanilla-JS-Quote/blob/main/custom.js) file to see the nitty gritty of how this works.
